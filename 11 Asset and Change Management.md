## Acquisition
Process of obtaining goods and services.

## Procurement
Process of acquiring goods and services and all preceding steps.

## Mobile Asset Deployment
#### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
Permits employees to use their own personal devices at work. But, employees themselves own the security and control of their devices.
To secure:
- Personal devices can undergo security checks and require specific software to protect company data
#### Corporate-Owned, Personally Enabled (COPE)
Involves the company providing a mobile device to employees for both work and personal use. Standardizes device management but can be expensive and requires manpower to monitor device activity.
#### Choose Your Own Device (CYOD)
Offers a middle ground between BYOD or COPE by allowing employees to choose devices from a company approved list. More freedom for employees, less burden on IT, but more expensive and raises employee data privacy concerns.

## Asset Management
Refers to the systematic approach to governing and maximizing the value of items an entity is responsible for throughout their lifecycle.
#### Assignment/Accounting
Should designate individuals or groups as owners of the asset.
#### Classification
Involves categorizing assets based on criteria like function, value, or other relevant parameters as determined by the organization.
#### Monitoring/Tracking
Ensures proper accountability and optimal use of each asset.
#### Asset Tracking
Involves maintaining a comprehensive inventory with asset specifications, locations, assigned users, and relevant details.
#### Enumeration
Involves identifying and counting assets, especially in large organizations or during times of asset procurement or retirement.
- Maintains accurate inventory
- Detects unauthorized devices
- Informs software update decisions
- Addresses security vulnerabilities
#### Mobile Device Management (MDM)
Lets organizations securely oversee employee devices, ensuring policy enforcement, software consistency, and data protection. Lowers risks tied to unsecured or outdated devices.

## Asset Disposal and Decommissioning
[Special Publication 800-88 | Guidelines for Media Sanitization](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-88r1.pdf)
#### Sanitization
Thorough process of making data inaccessible and irretrievable from a storage medium using traditional forensic methods.
###### Overwriting Data
Replacing the existing data on a storage device with random bits of information to ensure that the original data is obscured. Performed several times:
- Single pass
- 7 passes
- 35 passes
###### Degaussing
Involves using a machine to produce a strong magnetic field that can disrupt the magnetic domains on storage devices like hard drives or tapes. Causes it to lose data storage capability.
###### Secure Erase
Completely deletes data from a storage device while ensuring that it can't be recovered using traditional recovery tools.
###### Cryptographic Erase
Introduced to replace secure erase. Much faster.
#### Destruction
Ensures physical device itself is beyond recovery or reuse.
- Shredding
- Pulverizing
- Melting
- Incinerating
#### Certification
An act of proof that the data or hardware has been securely disposed of. Create an audit log of the sanitization or destruction process.

## Change Management
Organization's orchestrated strategy to transition from one state to a desirable future state.
#### Change Advisory Board (CAB)
Body of representatives from various parts of the organization that is responsible for evaluation of any proposed changes.
#### Change Owner
Individual or team that initiates a change request.
#### Impact Analysis
Integral part of change management process that involves understanding of change's potential fallout.
- What could go wrong?
- What would be the immediate effects?
- How would the long-term operations be impacted?
- Are there unforeseen challenges that might cause an issue?
#### Process of Change Management
1. **Preparation**
	1. Gather necessary resources
	2. Engage stakeholders
	3. Ensure preparedness
2. **Vision for Change**
	1. Define future state
	2. Explain reasons for change
	3. Ensure vivid vision
3. **Implementation**
	1. Training
	2. Restructuring Teams
	3. Introducing new technologies
	4. Continuous communication
4. **Verification**
	1. Surveys
	2. Performance metrics analysis
	3. Stakeholder interviews
5. **Documentation**
	1. Reflect on past initiatives
	2. Understand decisions
	3. Improve practices
###### Considerations
- Use of scheduled maintenance windows
- Creation of backout plan
- Testing results
- Use of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)

## Technical Implementations
**Considerations**
1. Allow or deny lists
	1. Permitted entities vs. prevented entities
2. Restricted activities
3. Downtime
4. Service and application restarts
5. Legacy Applications
6. Dependencies

## Documentation
#### Version Control
Tracks and manages changes in documents and software, enabling collaborative work and reverting to prior versions when needed.
#### Proper Documentation
- Properly record changes and documents
- Update diagrams
- Revise policies and procedures
- Update change requests
- Maintain associated trouble tickets
#### Maintenance of Associated Records
